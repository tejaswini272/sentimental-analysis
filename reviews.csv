  Got this one for my son, to help with stacking. He has special needs and stacking was one of the areas he was struggling with. During his OT they used a variant of this stacker with a lot of success, so while I was still at their office, I ordered one. So far, so good. He likes it, specially the red ring with yellow dots. He also liked the one with the beads inside. The rings are made out of plastic and appear to be durable.Update: They are very durable. Over a year has passed and they are still going strong.

  My six-month-old granddaughter loves this toy. She’s too young for stacking, but enjoys exploring the different rings. They have different colors and textures, and her favorite is the clear rattle. Very thoughtfully designed toy that will provide several years of fun and learning.

  Love the versatility of play offered by this toy especially compared to the traditional ring stacker. Black and white rings can be used in newborn days to show baby contrasting patterns. One ring can be used as a rattle. All rings can be used for exploring textures and teething. The only things that I would like to see improved are holes in some loops being bigger so the toy could be used in later years as a ring toss and the material being used to be something other than plastic.

  Purchased these for my 7-month-old. The quality and design are great. The circles have different weights, shapes, and sizes which are great for learning. A couple of the smaller rings are made somewhat out of a softer material so it's not as hard when the baby tries to bite/chew on it.

  Our 10-month old has been using this set since she was 3 months.  Her favorite is the clear ring that rattles.  She likes removing them and banging them together.  She still is yet to learn how to put them back on the stacker, so still more use coming up for this toy.  Even the stacker unscrews from the base, giving you two additional toys.

  I bought these stacking rings for my 8 month old to play and teeth on, but mainly to stimulate her mind. Upon searching these were the most unique ones that I felt would capture her attention and soon love (she already loves them, day 2.)The only flaw, and this is totally just me I'm sure, the orange ring triggers trypophobia (an uncomfortable feeling or discomfort/disgust with holes/bumps...don't google it 🙈🤢). Obviously I saw the photos before buying it, but figured I could switch it out with something else, or perhaps it won't bug me in person. In full light it's totally fine, but for some people it may not be good in any circumstance. I have another little rattle thing from a seperate playmat that my baby loves, I can put on there instead of the orange one, so there's totally a work around if you need it. This set rocks, so don't avoid buying it just because one ring looks bleh.The orange and magenta rings are hollow plastic and therefore squishy so they're good to teeth on, I assume lol. The blue spotted one is harder plastic, but feel like a teething material, as are the small blue dotted one and the black and white striped ring. The clear, green and yellow rings are the only hard plastic ones not perfect for teething, but great for banging on things!All in all, I'm very satisfied with this toy! Its smaller than what you'd expect based on pervious experiences with other stacking rings, but PERFECT for little ones! (Johnson bedtime lotion for scale 📷😉)

  Do not buy this toy- major choking hazard. My baby dropped this toy on the floor (as 6-month-old babies do) and the base opened up, with many small pieces coming apart (including tiny screws!!) that could be huge choking hazards. Thankfully I was right there and picked up all the pieces.

  I bought this stacking ring set almost a year ago. At first I thought it was a good toy, but now I have noticed that since my almost 14 month old daughter likes to chew on the rings more so than stacking them, I have noticed how bits of the silicone have been peeling off the rings.She has 8 teeth. I’m trying to only present this toy with supervision now but I am worried about how much of the fragments she has ingested by now.Will not buy this again, these particular rings look very worn.

  My baby loved this ring tower, especially the clear ring that rattles. I have had only two concerns. My husband and I clean and sterilize his toys often, and my husband tried to put the solid plastic rings in the pabalic sterilizer we use and it completed flattened and warped them so they no longer fit onto the ring base. I suppose the instruction manual probably warned about that, but we do like toys that are safe for sterilizers. The other issue is with the rattle ring I mentioned - another cleaning fail. I typically soak the baby's plastic toys in warm soapy water then rinse and sterilize, but since this was a two piece toy I didn't want to chance getting steam inside of it, but I suppose I should have been as worried as the water and soap getting inside because that's exactly what it did. It took forever to try to drain because it's not intended to be able to open. Please know that I don't blame this on manufacturing, we should have read up before we cleaned. So, long story short, your baby will probably love this, but when you want to clean it, just use a warm washcloth to wipe it down.

  These rings are fun to play with and my daughter loves the rattle one. Since the rings all have the same size hole in them, they can be placed on the post in any order, which is great when they’re still learning.I took a star off because the post the rings go through is a thin, hollow plastic that could get warped with time. I also don’t love that when my little one bites the softer rings, the indentation of her teeth stays. While she’s not biting pieces off, it means it’s not the best teething toy since bites leave a mark.

  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my great granddaughter but ended up keeping it at my house for her to play with. The things I like about it are it's really bright and colorful and she can easily handle getting the rings off and on by herself. She likes to chew on the small ones and since shes cutting teeth and likes to chew on everything this is great.The first 4 rings are hard, easy to pick up and have different textures i.e. wavy, bumps, grooves, etc.  The next three are bigger and softer and also different textured surfaces.The thing I didn't like was that the base isn't weighted at all and the bottom ring doesn't come off which is the only thing that is suppose to keep it balanced and upright and while it might do a slightly better job on a hard surface like tile or hardwood, it was a total fail on carpet or a blanket. On the bright side it also doesn't make a very good weapon for her older brother to use against her so I guess that could move it back into the plus column.Oh and the price was okay when I bought it and I see that it's cheaper now so go for it. I'm not sure it will last as long as the Fisher Price brand I would have normally bought but it is brighter and cuter and the teether rings make it more functional and my granddaughter happier for sure.

  My favorite part of this product is that all the rings fit in any order. My grandson first started using this (well, I helped) when he was about 6 months old. Even now at 10 months I'm quite sure he would get frustrated if he had to put them on in a particular order to make them fit. Also, each ring is quite different from the other rings so the toy provides a lot more sensory experience than the traditional ring stacker. Not just colors, but the way each ring feels is very different. And it's well made and durable, so no problems there.Great product!!

  This was much smaller than I expected it to be but that turned out to be perfect for my 9 month old. The first day he played with it (specifically the base with no rings on it) for about 30 minutes which is an eternity for a baby. Now he's had it for a couple weeks he's not so enthralled but he still likes to wave and chew on the base and rattle one of the rings. I'm sure as he gets older he will get more use out of it.

  Bought this for 7-month-old my nephew and it has quickly become one of his favorite toys.  I watched him crawl over to his toy box, tip it over, and throw things out to get this.  Each ring is unique with different widths, textures, and colors & it has been interesting seeing which he gravitates to most.  He can carry them as he crawls or stands by the couch and, as he is teething, most have made their way into his mouth at some point.

  As another reviewer said, it is much smaller than anticipated.  I have noticed this to be a real problem with Amazon baby toys.  The size is not included in the upfront description and you would never expect it to be as small from the pictures (perhaps it's the angle they use), but I feel deceived.  Additionally, this just felt cheap.  I don't know why it's considered a ""STEM"" toy.  There's nothing really interesting about it.  The rings didn't come off easily, seemed flimsy and had nothing to catch a baby's eye.  Going back ASAP.

  My baby’s current favorite toy! She went right on mouthing the rings when I added this on her toy rotation.I just checked each ring and those that don’t seem to have holes, I washed with warm soap and water.  Those with something that look like holes, I just wiped using Force of Nature cleaner (didn’t want to wash with water and risk molds).The toy is the right size for small fingers and hands, very easy to manipulate and play with.  My seven-month old baby doesn’t know how to shoot in the pole just yet, but she enjoys taking them out one by one (or turning the whole toy upside down so all the rings slide out the pole).  It’s also nice that, although each ring has a small number somewhere, they can still be stacked in no particular order.I recommend this! 👍🏽

  I had originally bought basic stacking rings that, from the bottom stack large to small (at top).  Saw these and decided to return the the ones I bought (even tho I'm paying a tad more for these).  These are great because you can stack them any which way, size does not matter (however, that option is still there).Each ring has a different texture/color/design.  My six month old grandson dove right into them.  He is not at an age, yet, to actually stack them...but he'll pull them off and play with the different pieces (as well as teeth on them, lol).  Because of the smaller rings it works those fine motor skills too!  I really like everything about this stacker and know it'll be a great toy as he grows...very happy with my purchase!

  This is a great toy. For young babies who don' tyet have the dexterity to stack, they will enjoy the colorful rings. As they get older, babies can stack these rings without frustration because the diameters of all the rings are the same size. I bought this for my twin granddaughters who are ten months old and these rings held their interest for quite a while. They loved holding one in each hand and shaking and banging the rings together.

  Although my 10-month-old hasn’t quite grasped the concept of stacking up the rings, and instead prefers to knock them down, I think this product still has many ways in which it can be played with. The variety of colors, sizes, and textures of each ring makes it stand out.My baby doesn’t quite use it as a teether, but he has found it fun in other ways. He particularly likes it when I spin the rings on the floor, which always causes a giggle fit. Any product that can make my baby giggle and laugh so hard will get a good review.Would make a good gift.

  Of the 4 ring stackers the kids have, this is by far their most favorite! I bought it after I saw how much the kids liked it when they played with it at their physical therapy visits. It was the only toy they both went nuts for.The rings have a wide opening making it easy for little hands to grab. The colors, weights and textures keep them interested and the post is lightweight (for when they start banging it at everything. Ack!)I also really appreciate the post is the same thickness, top to bottom. Other stackers have a smaller top and fatter at the bottom post. These types of stackers frustrate kids that are still too young to understand larger goes on bottom then the smaller ones. With this Sassy stacker, it doesn’t matter! The kids can stack them in whatever order they choose and not becomes frustrated or lose interest.Although I don’t recommend this as a teether, it worked great as one. No pieces or shavings came off the rings. The paint/coloring does not flake or peel off even after repeated biting.Great ring stacker for infants!

  I love this toy. For starters, yes it’s smaller, but i couldn’t care less because of all the pros to it. My son is 9 months old and within minutes understood how to take the rings off, the rings are all different colors (very bright) and thicknesses and even different textures, some rings can be used as teethers, one ring is even a rattle. While the rings are different thickness, they can be stacked in any order, or used alone as individual toys. This toy was definitely made with intent behind it, i can only speak for my son but most baby’s should love how colorful and interesting each individual ring is. It’s very stimulating with the sounds and colors and textures. So much fun, would definitely buy again.

  Got this for my six month old and two months later, it’s still one of his favorite toys! He loves to chomp on the different textures and even finds the stand entertaining. This will grow with him as he learns to stack and better understand patterns and colors.

  Lots of rings. There are multiple colors and textures. One ring is a rattle. The rings can be chewed no matter the size. They are a lot of fun. At first the baby may just turn it upside down to get the rings off. Eventually, the baby will try to put them back on. All rings stack no matter the order.  I have seen the base used as a pretend microphone.  It's a lot of fun! One thing to watch for is these look like bracelets. So, when baby starts growing they can get stuck.

  First of all, the item said it was delivered and it never was. I reached out to the company and they refunded me but never offered to send another one. I then reached out to Amazon because I still wanted this toy at the price I originally bought it at. Amazon was able to send me another one for that price.I expected this toy to be a little larger. The first two rings on top of the toy are very small and thin. Almost concerning as I'm wondering if a child (a little older) could squeeze the ring into their mouth.

  My one year old daughter gets distracted easily (as I think most of you can relate), so when she was playing with this for more than 10 minutes at a time, I considered it a major hit. Meticulously stacks each fun colored and textured ring and shakes the one that has beads in it which is clearly her favorite. The center stacking pole is pretty light so it does tip over sometimes when she puts the ring on, but she quickly learned to hold it while she puts the ring on which I think is actually great because she learned a new skill.

  These stacking rings are so cute! I bought them for my daughter when she was 5 months old (she’s 11 months now) and she still loves them. Before they were just for teething but now she’s actually getting the hang of stacking them and it’s the most adorable thing. I love the high contrast colors and the different textures which is why I chose this one over the basic rainbow fisher price one. The only thing is that the pink ring on it has a little bit too small of a hole. When taking that piece off, it kind of gets stuck at the top (I think it’s because the base/stick is just one width from top to bottom and doesn’t get skinnier towards the top). This makes it nearly impossible for a baby to get this piece off. I ended up just throwing that piece out and replacing it with a teething ring we already had. No biggie but if that issue was fixed I definitely would have given this 5 stars!

But decided to get it anyway and WOW, it’s been about 3 months since we got it and he uses this toy daily for most of the day. It’s always my go to if we’re out and about on a stroll walk or in a restaurant. This plus his stacking blocks are his absolute favorite

  Fun colors and textures captivate my babies attention. They are easy to wash, although the one with the beads in it I do take more care for fear of water leaking on the inside and getting gunky. I prefer wooden or more sustainable toys but I feel that these will hold up well enough that I will be able to use them for multiple children

  I bought 2 of these- one for each of my two baby grandaughters- 6 and 9 months. One already had it, so that one is waiting for the next one yet to come. :)  The colors and variety of textures are great. They'll learn the stacking by size part later. Right now they like to dump the rings off and gnaw on them one by one.  Good toy!
